## Creating New Images of Faces with Deep Convolutional GANs (DCGANs)

This project generates new images of faces with Deep Convolutional GANs (DCGANs) in PyTorch. It is trained on the CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html). 

The notebook is an exercise of Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree.

### Instructions

This project requires **Python** and the following Python libraries installed:

- NumPy
- torch
- torchvision
- matplotlib
- pickle
